Please read before submitting a pull requests


Before creating a pull-request please run `ggd check-recipe path/to/recipe-dir/`.
    * If any errors occur, fix them prior to creating a PR
    * Look for:
    ```
    ****************************
    * Successful recipe check! *
    ****************************
    ```
    * Once check-recipe has validated the build, you may submit a PR.
    * NOTE: If you submit a PR prior to a successful validation, your recipe will not pass additional automated testing and will be rejected until the recipe is fixed.
    * Make sure that the processed data files have a header, if appropriate 

The ggd comand line interface can be install via: `pip install -U git+git://github.com/gogetdata/ggd-cli.git`

Automated testing is supported by CircleCI. If your pull-request errors on CircleCI, read the log carefully and fix the errors

GGD recipe review is required to merge a pull-request (PR). Once your PR is passing tests on CircleCI and is ready to be merged, add the `please review & merge` label to the PR. NOTE: If you are NOT a member of the gogetdata project (meaning that you can't add this label), add a comment requesting that the label be added.
