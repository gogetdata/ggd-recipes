  summary: 'Gene features from Ensembl Release-100 for protein-coding canonical transcripts
    based on the APPRIS transcript annotations. Features include gene, transcript,
    CDS, five_prime_utr, three_prime_utr, exon, start_codon, and stop_codon for all
    canonical transcripts. Canonical transcripts are determined based on APPRIS annotations.
    In short, for all protein coding transcripts, transcripts are filtered based on
    APPRIS isoform flags. If multiple transcripts of the same gene have equal flags,
    the isoform with the most exons is chosen. If all transcritps for a gene annotated
    by APPRIS are missing from the base gtf file no canonical transcript is chosen
    and the gene is removed. APPRIS flag information can be found here: http://appris-tools.org/#/downloads
    or here: https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/transcript_quality_tags.html.
