  summary: 'Exon Coding Features. Exons that overlap coding regions in protein coding
    genes. Features are from Ensembl gene sets.  All other features, including non-coding
    exon features and non-protein coding exon features, have been removed. (Alignment
    based annotation using proteins, cDNA, RNA-seq, etc.). Features include: exon
    (exons that overlap coding regions in protein coding genes). Features are in GTF
    format'
