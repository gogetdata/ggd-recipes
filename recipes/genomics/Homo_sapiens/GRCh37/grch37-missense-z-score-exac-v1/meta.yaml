  summary: 'Missense Z Score by gene. A constraint score based on missense variation,
    from Samocha et al., Nature Genetics 2014. The score is derived by calculating
    a null expectation of missense variation for each gene, and comparing it to what
    is observed in ExAC, then stratifying each gene using a Z score distribution.
