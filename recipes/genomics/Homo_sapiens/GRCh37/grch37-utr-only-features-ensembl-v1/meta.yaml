  summary: 'UTR only features from Ensembl gene sets. All other features have been
    removed. (Alignment based annotation using proteins, cDNA, RNA-seq, etc.) UTRs
    have been designated as 5'' UTRs or 3'' UTRs based on the coding region and strand
    of the associated gene .Features include: five_prime_utr, three_prime_utr. Features
    are in GTF format.'
