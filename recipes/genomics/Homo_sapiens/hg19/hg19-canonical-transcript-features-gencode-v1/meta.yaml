  summary: 'Protein Coding Canonical Transcript Features for each protein coding gene
    id from GENCODE''s v34 (Ensembl 100) comprehensive set of gene anntotations. Originally
    created on GRCh38 and mapped to GRCh37 by GENCODE (v34lift37). Some annotations
    were obtained from GENCODE v19 when mapping failed. Scaffoldings, assenbly patches,
    and alternative loci are NOT included. Canonical Transcripts are determined using
    the APPRIS annotation dataset. In short, for all protein coding transcripts, transcripts
    are filtered based on APPRIS isoform flags. If multiple transcripts of the same
    gene have equal flags, the isoform with the most exons is chosen. If all transcritps
    for a gene are not annotated by APPRIS, the transcript with the most exons is
    chosen as the canonical transcript. APPRIS flag information can be found here:
    http://appris-tools.org/#/downloads or here: https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/transcript_quality_tags.html.
    Features include: gene, transcript, exon, CDS, UTR, start_codon, stop_codon, and
    Selenocysteine. Remapped from Ensembl GRCh37 to UCSC hg19'
