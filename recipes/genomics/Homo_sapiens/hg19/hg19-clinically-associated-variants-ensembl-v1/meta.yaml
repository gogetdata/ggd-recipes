  summary: '**Liftover** All known clinically associated variants at the time of Ensembl
    release 99. Any variant in ClinVar classified as probably/likely-pathogenic, pathogenic,
    drug-response, or histocompatibility are included. Decomposed and Normalized.
    Liftover from GRCh38 to GRCh37. Remapped from Ensembl GRCh37 to UCSC hg19. Ensembl
