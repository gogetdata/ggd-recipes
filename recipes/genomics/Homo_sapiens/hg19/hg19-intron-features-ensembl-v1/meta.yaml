  summary: 'Intron features created from the Ensembl gene features, including all
    annotated transcripts, that make up the Ensembl gene sets. Intron features for
    each transcripts have been added to the annotation set. All other features are
    removed. (Alignment based annotation using proteins, cDNA, RNA-seq, etc.). Features
    include: intron. Features are in GTF format. Remapped from Ensembl GRCh37 to UCSC
    hg19'
