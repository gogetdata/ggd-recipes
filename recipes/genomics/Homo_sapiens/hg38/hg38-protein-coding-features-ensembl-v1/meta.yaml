  summary: 'Protein Coding Features based on feature''s gene biotype from Ensembl
    gene sets. All non-protein coding features have been removed. (Alignment based
    annotation using proteins, cDNA, RNA-seq, etc.). Features include: CDS, Selenocysteine,
    five_prime_utr, three_prime_utr, exon, gene, start_codon, stop_codon, transcript.
    Features are in GTF format. Remapped from Ensembl GRCh38 to UCSC hg38'
