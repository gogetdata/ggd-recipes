  summary: 'UTR only features from the comprehensive set of gene annotations including
    reference chromosomes, scaffoldings, assembly patches, and alternative loci. All
    other features have been removed. UTRs have been designated as 5'' UTRs or 3''
    UTRs based on the coding region and strand of the associated gene. Data is specific
    to GENCODE Release 34 (Ensembl 100). Features include: five_prime_utr, three_prime_utr.
    Remapped from Ensembl GRCh38 to UCSC hg38.'
