ggd search is used to search for a data package stored within the ggd system. It is dependent on the ggd channel
provided.


Using ggd search
----------------
Once ggd is installed on your system you can run :code:`ggd search` to search for available data packages.
Running :code:`ggd search -h` will give you the following help message:

Search arguments:

-h, --help                                    show this help message and exit

-t TERM, --term TERM                          (**Required**) term(s) upon which to search. Multiple terms can be
                                              specified as a space-delimited list, e.g. '-t reference genome'.

-g GENOME_BUILD, --genome_build GENOME_BUILD  (Optional) The genome build of the desired recipe. This is used
                                              to filter the search results on a specific "genome build". This
                                              flag is not required, however, if provided the resulting search
                                              will be filtered to only include data packages with this genome
                                              build.

-s SPECIES, --species SPECIES                 (Optional) The species for the desired recipe. This is used to
                                              filter the search results on a specific "species". Only data
                                              packages for that specific species will be displayed. Species is
                                              limited to Drosophila_melanogaster, Homo_sapiens, Canis_familiaris, and
                                              Mus_musculus.

-k KEYWORD, --keyword KEYWORD                 (Optional) Filter based on keyword(s) used to describe the recipe.
                                              Multiple keywords can be used, e.g. '-k ref reference genome'.

-m MATCH_SCORE, --match_score MATCH_SCORE     (Optional) A score between 0 and 100 to use percent match between
                                              the search term(s) and the ggd-recipes. This represents the "match"
                                              score to use for searching. A fuzzy word match is used to identify
                                              similar packages to the terms that were searched, and the match
                                              score defines which packages will be displayed based on a cutoff.
                                              A default match score cutoff is provided, but this flag can be
                                              used to provide more strict or more lenient search results.

-c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                                              (Optional) The ggd channel to search. (Default = genomics)


Any combination of search flags can be used to search for a package with the exception of the -t flag, which is required.

Additional argument explanation: 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Required arguments:

* *-t:* The :code:`-t` flag represents the "terms" to search for. At least one search term is required, but multiple can be provided 

Optional arguments:

* *-g:* The :code:`-g` flag is used to filter the search results on a specific "genome build". This flag is not required, however, if 
  provided the resulting search will be filtered to only include data packages with that genome build.
* *-s:* The :code:`-s` flag is used to filter the search results on a specific "species". Only data packages for that specific species 
  will be displayed.
* *-k:* The :code:`-k` flag is used to filter the search results based on keywords assigned to a pacakge. 
* *-m:* The :code:`-m` flag represents the "match" score to use for searcing. A fuzzy word match is used to identify similar packages
  to the terms search for, and the match score defines which packages will be displayed based on a cutoff. A default match score
  cutoff is provided, but this flag can be used to provide more strict or more lenient search results.
* *-c:* The :code:`-c` flag is used to set the ggd channel to search in. The ggd-genomics channel is set by default.



Example
-------
Some examples of using the `ggd search` tool:

1. Simple example with one search term:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ggd search -t reference

      grch37-reference-genome
       Summary: GRCh37 reference genome from 1000 genomes
       Species: Homo_sapiens
       Genome Build: GRCh37
       Keywords: ref, reference
       Data Version: phase2_reference

       To install run:
           ggd install grch37-reference-genomet

      grch38-reference-genome


2. Simple example with two search terms:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ggd search -t repeat masker

      hg38-repeatmasker
       Summary: RepeatMasker track from UCSC
       Species: Homo_sapiens
       Genome Build: hg38
       Keywords: rmsk, region
       Data Version: 06-Mar-2014

       To install run:
           ggd install hg38-repeatmasker


      hg19-repeatmasker
       Summary: RepeatMasker track from UCSC
       Species: Homo_sapiens
       Genome Build: hg19
       Keywords: rmsk, region
       Data Version: 27-Apr-2009

       To install run:
           ggd install hg19-repeatmasker


3. Example using ``-g``, ``-s``, and ``-k`` flags to filter the results:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ggd search -t reference genome -g grch37 -s Homo_sapiens -k ref

      grch37-reference-genome
       Summary: GRCh37 reference genome from 1000 genomes
       Species: Homo_sapiens
       Genome Build: GRCh37
       Keywords: ref, reference
       Data Version: phase2_reference
