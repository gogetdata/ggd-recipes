**For a quick guide to start using ggd see:** :ref:`GGD Quick Start <quick-start>`

Go Get Data (ggd) is a data management system that provides access to data package containing auto curated genomic data.
ggd hosts data packages that contain information on how to extract and process scientific data, providing access
to a growing number of scientific datasets without the hassle of finding, downloading, and processing them
yourself. ggd leverages the `conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html>`_ package management system
and the infrastructure of `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io/index.html>`_ to provide a stable source
of datasets and ease annotation reproducibility. Using the ggd data management system allows any user to quickly
access a desired dataset(s), and provides a platform upon which to cite data access and use by way of the ggd
data package name and version.

ggd consists of:
++++++++++++++++

- a `repository of data recipes <https://github.com/gogetdata/ggd-recipes>`_ hosted on Github
- a `command line interface (cli) <https://github.com/gogetdata/ggd-cli>`_ to communicate with the ggd system
- a continually growing list of genomic recipes to provide quick and easy access to processed genomic data
  using the ggd cli tool

Capabilities
++++++++++++

See :ref:`GGD Quick Start <quick-start>` to start using ggd with minimal information. 

Use :code:`ggd` to search, find, and install a data package hosted by ggd. The data package will be installed and processed
on your system, and give you ready-to-use data files. For additional information see :ref:`Using GGD<using-ggd>`.

Example:
++++++++

1. Lets say you you need to align some sequence(s) to the human reference genome for an analysis you are doing. 
   You will need download the reference genome from one of the sites that hosts it. You will need make sure it is 
   the correct genome build, it is the right reference genome, and download it from the site. You will then need 
   to sort and index the reference genome before you can use it. GGD simplifies this process by allowing you to search
   and install avaible processed genomic data packages using the ggd tool.
