:code:`ggd predict-path` is used to predict that path of a data file from a ggd data package that has not been installed yet. Workflows, such as Snakemake, 
require knowledge of the file path prior to running the workflow. Using the `predict-path` tool would allow someone using Snakemake to provide the predict file 
paths of the data files they would like to use without having to pre-install the data packages.The installation of the data packages could take place later in the 
workflow process. 


Using ggd predict-path
----------------------
Use :code:`ggd predict-path` to predict the path of a data file prior to installing the ggd data package.
Running :code:`ggd predict-path -h` will give you the following message:

Additional argument explanation: 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Required arguments:

* *-pn:* The :code:`-pn` flag represents the data package name for which to predict a file path for. (NOTE: the file 
  path is for a data file from this data package and not the data package itself)

* *-fn:* The :code:`-fn` flag represents the name of the data file for which to predict the file path for. (NOTE: this is 
  the actual file from the data package to predict the path for) You can use :code:`ggd search` or check the 
  :ref:`Available packages <recipes>` page to get the name of the files provided by the package


Optional arguments:

* *-c:* The :code:`-c` flag represents the ggd channel. The default channel is *genomics*.
   
* *--prefix:* The :code:`--prefix` flag is used to get to the install path for a data file in a specific conda  environment/prefix
  that is different then the current environment.
